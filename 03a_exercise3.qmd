## Question 2 {.unnumbered}

The mean and standard deviation of waiting times in weeks for hearings in the Crown Court between 2020 and 2023 are given in the table below. Using this information, what can you tell about the distribution of these times? 

```{r}
#| echo: false

tibble(year = 2020:2023,
       mean_wait = c(13.5, 19.1, 20.9, 22.8),
       sd_wait = c(10.2, 15.6, 13.9, 14.7)) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(year = "Year",
                    mean_wait = "Mean waiting time (weeks)",
                    sd_wait = "Standard deviation waiting time (weeks)") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  bold(part = "header") %>% 
  bg(part = "all", bg = "grey95")
```
