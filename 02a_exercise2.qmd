# Exercise 2: data visualisation {.unnumbered}

Below are three visualisations taken from the [Offender Management Statistics report in 2023](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/offender-management-statistics-quarterly-october-to-december-2023/offender-management-statistics-quarterly-october-to-december-2023-and-annual-2023). Interpret these graphs, note any trends, any surprising results, and anything you would check in the data if this was your work. Make a note of things the visualisation did well and ways in which it could be improved.
