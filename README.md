# Introduction to Statistical Thinking 

A short course originally designed for the UK Ministry of Justice introducing the concept of **statistical thinking**. 

Many people assume that statistics require complex analysis methods but often, the simplest approaches can be the most effective. This course focuses on the concept of statistically thinking, describing data and complex systems in relatively simple terms whilst acknowledging underlying uncertainty. Statistical thinking is a necessary skill, not just in work but in our personal lives too. We are constantly bombarded by data via the news and social media. Often the claims made here are exaggerated or skewed to fit a certain narrative. Thinking statistically allows us to sift through all these conflicting claims and make our own minds up based on evidence. 

The process of statistical thinking involves critically appraising available data, identifying patterns using visualisations and summaries, and communicating results in a clear, concise manner. Statistical thinking could be thought of as data-driven critical thinking. This course does not introduce any complex analysis methods, nor does it require the use of any statistical software. No prior statistical training is required.

Topics that will be covered in this course include:
* The importance of a clear, well-defined research question and how to formulate this
* Common biases and how to recognise them
* Data visualisation as a tool to explore data, investigate trends, and convey important messages
* Summarising data and quantifying differences or trends
